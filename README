This git repo provides a collection of miscellaneous scripts
I've written, mostly for managing QEMU building, pull request
processing and so on.

Licensing is generally GPLv2-or-later, but check comments on
individual scripts.

Since they're primarily personal-use scripts, documentation
usage examples and error handling can be a bit sketchy. Patches
welcome...
